Smart Sitemap Generator is a simple plugin that allows you to intelligently generate XML Sitemap outputs of your posts, pages and products automatically.

== Description ==

After installing the Smart Sitemap Generator Plugin, you can automatically generate XML sitemaps and exclude any font you want, thanks to easy admin panel settings.

Since the sitemaps created with Smart Sitemap Generator create fixed xml files no matter how much content you have, it generates sitemaps consisting of 1000 URLs without affecting your visitor performance and adds them all to a main directory.

Thanks to the settings in the Smart Sitemap Generator Admin interface, you can regenerate XML sitemaps as you wish, 24 hours a day or in different periods.

You can activate or deactivate it in combination with plugins such as Yoast SEO, All in One SEO, Rank Math SEO.
