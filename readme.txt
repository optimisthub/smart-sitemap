Smart Sitemaps is a simple plugin that allows you to intelligently generate XML Sitemap outputs of your posts, pages and products automatically.

== Description ==

Smart Sitemaps Eklentisini kurduktan sonra, kolay admin panel ayarları sayesinde, isterseniz XML sitemap'leri otomatik ürettirebilir, dilediğiniz yazı türlerini hariç tutabilirsiniz.

Since the sitemaps created with Smart Sitemaps create fixed xml files no matter how much content you have, it generates sitemaps consisting of 1000 URLs without affecting your visitor performance and adds them all to a main directory.

Thanks to the settings in the Smart Sitemaps Admin interface, you can regenerate XML sitemaps as you wish, 24 hours a day or in different periods.

You can activate or deactivate it in combination with plugins such as Yoast SEO, All in One SEO, Rank Math SEO.
